# Data Structures and Algorithm
I will be adding Data Structures and Algorithm Resources week wise here so that you can follow these through.

## Week 1: Quick Revision of C++
This is standard C++ website that you can keep in your list to refer whenever you want to check some syntax or inbuilt libraries - [CPlusPlus](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)

These are again some quick standard resources to revise C++:
- [C++ W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)
- [CPP Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming)
- [C++ Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm)

Revise loops, strings, arrays and pointers from any of these resources.

## Week 2: Abstract Data Types
This is like an introductory topic to data structures, follow [this introductory article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-data-types/) on ADT. Mainly study what Lists, Stacks and Queues are. You can follow these or any other available online.

- [List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/list-cpp-stl/)
- [Queue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-cpp-stl/)
- [Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-in-cpp-stl/)

## Week 3: Sorting Algorithms 
These are basic most algorithms to know when studying DSA and come handy while solving lot of problems. Start of with the basic ones like binary search, merge sort, selection sort, quick sort and insertion sort. You can look up various others as well. Study what kind of data structure is used to code these. Refer to any of these links (make a note of these website, comes handy - follow any one of these).

## Week 4: Object Oriented Programming 
Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. And, it is usually a good practice to know OOPs as it makes the code modular, flexible and more efficient. Do read encapsulation and inheritence.

- [Introduction to OOPS in C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_oop.asp)
- [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/)
- [Full Course on OOPS](https://youtu.be/wN0x9eZLix4)

## Week 5: Dynamic Memory Management
Dynamic memory allocation is when an executing program requests that the operating system give it a block of main memory. The program then uses this memory for some purpose. Usually the purpose is to add a node to a data structure. It is also an important concept in OOPs, so follow these links below:

- [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_dynamic_memory.htm)
- [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/new-and-delete-operators-in-cpp-for-dynamic-memory/)
- [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/memory-management)

## Week 6: Time Analysis of Algorithms
In theoretical analysis of algorithms, it is common to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense, i.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. So, it is a good point to start with asymptotic analysis and notations which will help you understand the algorithms better later.

- [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-time-complexity-simple-examples/)

## Week 7: Binary Search Trees + Wrap Up!
First, you should look up what [Binary Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/) are. This is a very useful data structure and would be good thing to wrap up with. They are a bit difficult to understand so take your time.

Some sources for Binary Trees:

- [Binary Trees](https://www.javatpoint.com/binary-tree)
- [Binary Trees Tutorial](https://youtu.be/vvey2QCs98o)

BST or Binary Search Trees are the most useful types of Binary Trees. Follow these resources:

- [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/)
- [BST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFq5mYUWEBk)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/introduction-to-data-structure-binary-search-tree/) -- very comprehensive, you can skip this if you feel this is difficult.
